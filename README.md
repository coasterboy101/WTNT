# WTNT

WARNING: This project is currently in a very early alpha stage! Use it at your own risk!

The Windows Ten Neutering Tool (or WTNT) is the solution for anyone who is annoyed by all the stupid things that Windows 10 does "automatically" to make your computer run "smoother". WTNT allows you to tweak things like forced automatic updating using an easy-ish to use GUI instead of mucking around with registry settings and group policies.
